# Elicitation Techniques Reference

This reference provides methods for extracting information and probing psychological responses. Used primarily in PSYCH tier Phase 2-P (Stimulus-Response Mapping).

**Ethical Note**: These techniques are for defensive purposes - understanding others to negotiate effectively, detect deception, and protect against manipulation. Not for exploitation.

## Core Principles

### Elicitation vs. Interrogation

| Elicitation | Interrogation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Conversational | Formal |
| Subject unaware | Subject aware |
| Low pressure | High pressure |
| Information flows naturally | Information extracted |
| Relationship preserved | Relationship strained |

### The Elicitation Mindset

1. **Genuine curiosity** - People detect fake interest
2. **Patience** - Let information flow, don't force
3. **Reciprocity** - Give to get
4. **Oblique approach** - Circle the target, don't charge
5. **Active listening** - React appropriately to encourage flow

---

## Primary Techniques

### 1. The Void (Silence)

**Mechanism**: Social discomfort with silence creates pressure to fill it.

**Execution**:
1. Ask an open question
2. Wait for response
3. When they finish, say nothing
4. Maintain expectant, non-judgmental expression
5. Wait 5-7 seconds (feels much longer)
6. They will often continue with additional information

**Best For**:
- Extracting additional detail
- Getting past rehearsed responses
- Revealing what they think is important

**Signals When Used**:
- What they add reveals priorities
- Discomfort tolerance indicates N-trait
- Quality of additions reveals preparation level

**Counter**: Simply ask "Did you want to add anything else?"

---

### 2. The Provocative Statement

**Mechanism**: People have strong urge to correct incorrect information, especially about themselves or their domain.

**Execution**:
1. Make a statement that is slightly wrong about their area
2. Frame it as confident/authoritative
3. Wait for correction
4. Use correction as anchor for follow-up

**Example**:
- "I understand your company uses Oracle for most database work..."
- (If they use PostgreSQL, they will correct, revealing tech stack)

**Best For**:
- Technical details they wouldn't normally share
- Competitive information
- Correcting your "misconceptions" about them

**Signals When Used**:
- Speed of correction indicates ego investment
- Detail of correction indicates expertise level
- Emotional tone indicates sensitivity

---

### 3. The Columbo Method

**Mechanism**: Feigned confusion/incompetence disarms and invites explanation.

**Execution**:
1. Adopt humble, confused demeanor
2. "I'm not sure I understand..."
3. "Could you explain that to me like I'm new to this?"
4. Ask "dumb" questions that require detailed answers
5. Let them be the expert

**Best For**:
- Complex technical information
- Disarming high-status individuals
- Getting explanations rather than jargon

**Signals When Used**:
- Patience with explanation indicates A-trait
- Condescension indicates potential narcissism
- Depth of explanation indicates actual expertise

**Counter**: They may oversimplify or become suspicious of your competence.

---

### 4. Bracketing

**Mechanism**: Anchor with high/low bounds to extract specific numbers.

**Execution**:
1. Establish you need a number
2. Offer deliberately too-high guess: "So roughly $500K?"
3. They correct downward: "No, more like $200K"
4. Or offer too-low: "I imagine around $50K?"
5. They correct upward
6. Triangulate from multiple anchors

**Example**:
- "Your team must be what, 50 people?"
- "Actually closer to 15"

**Best For**:
- Financial information
- Headcount
- Timeline estimates
- Any numerical data

**Signals When Used**:
- Precision of correction indicates data access
- Hesitation indicates possible deception
- Counter-question indicates awareness of technique

---

### 5. Assumed Knowledge

**Mechanism**: Act as if you already know, ask for "confirmation" of details.

**Execution**:
1. State something as if already known
2. Ask for clarifying detail, not the base information
3. "So with the Johnson deal closing last month... who handled the integration?"

**Best For**:
- Confirming rumors/intelligence
- Getting details when you have outline
- Testing what they think you know

**Signals When Used**:
- Non-correction confirms the premise
- Correction may reveal truth or counter-intel
- Surprise indicates you know more than expected

**Warning**: Risky if obviously wrong - reveals your ignorance.

---

### 6. Flattery Bridge

**Mechanism**: Ego activation loosens information control.

**Execution**:
1. Offer genuine-seeming compliment about expertise
2. Follow immediately with question leveraging that expertise
3. "You clearly have deep experience with supply chain... how does that play into the current situation?"

**Best For**:
- High-narcissism targets
- Establishing rapport quickly
- Getting expert opinion disguised as conversation

**Signals When Used**:
- Acceptance of flattery indicates narcissism level
- Deflection indicates possible low-N or awareness
- Over-delivery indicates ego-accessible

**Warning**: Obvious flattery backfires. Must be plausible.

---

### 7. The Hypothetical

**Mechanism**: Hypothetical framing feels safer, people reveal actual views.

**Execution**:
1. Frame question as hypothetical or about "someone else"
2. "If someone were to [scenario], what do you think would happen?"
3. "How would you advise someone in [their situation]?"

**Best For**:
- Sensitive topics
- Future intentions
- Ethical boundaries
- Self-assessment they wouldn't give directly

**Signals When Used**:
- Engagement with hypothetical indicates relevance
- Avoidance indicates hit on sensitive area
- Detail indicates likely personal experience

---

### 8. Mutual Interest Building

**Mechanism**: Shared complaints or interests create alliance and information sharing.

**Execution**:
1. Find common ground (shared frustration, interest, enemy)
2. Share your own relevant information first
3. Create reciprocity obligation
4. Information flows more freely within "alliance"

**Example**:
- "The compliance requirements have been brutal for us too. How are you handling the new regulations?"

**Best For**:
- Long-term relationship building
- Sustained information access
- Navigating organizational politics

**Signals When Used**:
- Reciprocation indicates trust building
- One-sidedness indicates extraction awareness
- Over-sharing indicates loneliness/need for alliance

---

### 9. The Challenge

**Mechanism**: Competitive or proud personalities can't resist proving capability.

**Execution**:
1. Express mild doubt about capability
2. "I'm not sure that's possible given the constraints..."
3. "Most teams struggle with that..."
4. They prove capability, revealing details

**Best For**:
- Low-A (competitive) personalities
- High-E personalities
- Capability assessment
- Getting them to demonstrate rather than claim

**Signals When Used**:
- Rise to challenge indicates ego investment
- Measured response indicates maturity
- Over-proving indicates insecurity

**Warning**: Can damage rapport with High-A personalities.

---

### 10. The Misstatement

**Mechanism**: Similar to provocative statement but softer - "accidentally" misremember.

**Execution**:
1. Reference previous conversation
2. Slightly misstate what they said
3. "As you mentioned last time, you're moving to AWS..."
4. They correct: "Actually I said we were considering it"
5. Continue from correction point

**Best For**:
- Clarifying ambiguous previous statements
- Testing consistency
- Getting updates on situations

## Probe Sequences for Traits

## Response Interpretation

### Baseline Deviation Framework

1. **Establish baseline** (Phase 1-P)
2. **Apply probe**
3. **Measure deviation from baseline**
4. **Interpret deviation, not absolute**

### Deviation Types

| Type | Signal |
|------|--------|
| **Increased latency** | Processing, discomfort, fabrication |
| **Decreased latency** | Prepared answer, rehearsed |
| **Increased length** | Compensation, justification |
| **Decreased length** | Avoidance, discomfort |
| **Topic change** | Evasion, discomfort |
| **Emotional shift** | Triggered area |
| **Physical leakage** | (If observable) Stress |

---

## Counter-Elicitation Awareness

### Signs You're Being Elicited
- Unusual curiosity about specific topics
- Flattery followed by questions
- Provocative statements about your domain
- Extended silences after your answers
