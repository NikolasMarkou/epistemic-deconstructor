## Big Five (OCEAN) Model

The Five-Factor Model is the most empirically validated personality framework. Each trait exists on a spectrum from low to high.

### Trait Indicators

| Trait | High Indicators | Low Indicators |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Openness (O)** | Abstract language, hypotheticals, creativity, curiosity, unconventional ideas | Concrete thinking, preference for routine, "that's how it's done", dismissal of novelty |
| **Conscientiousness (C)** | Detail-oriented, organized, punctual, follows through, structured communication | Disorganized, misses deadlines, vague commitments, impulsive decisions |
| **Extraversion (E)** | Talkative, seeks social interaction, energized by groups, quick to engage | Reserved, prefers solitude, thoughtful pauses, energy depleted by interaction |
| **Agreeableness (A)** | Accommodating, avoids conflict, trusting, cooperative, empathetic language | Competitive, confrontational, skeptical, "zero-sum" framing, blunt criticism |
| **Neuroticism (N)** | Anxiety markers, catastrophizing, emotional volatility, self-doubt, defensive | Calm under pressure, stable mood, confident, dismissive of risk |

## Dark Triad Assessment

The Dark Triad comprises three socially aversive traits that, while clinically distinct, often co-occur. **Always assess all three** as they interact and inform negotiation strategy.

### Trait Definitions & Markers

| Trait | Core Feature | Key Markers |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Narcissism** | Grandiosity, need for admiration | Self-referential language, name-dropping, excessive "I", dismissive of others' achievements, sensitivity to criticism |
| **Machiavellianism** | Strategic manipulation, long-term scheming | Instrumental view of relationships, delayed gratification, information hoarding, alliance-building, calculated disclosure |
| **Psychopathy** | Callousness, impulsivity, lack of remorse | Shallow affect, thrill-seeking, broken promises without guilt, parasitic lifestyle, blame externalization |

### Narcissism Deep Dive

**High Narcissism Indicators:**
- Excessive self-promotion unprompted
- Steers conversations back to self
- Reacts poorly to criticism (rage or dismissal)
- Devalues others' contributions
- Requires special treatment or exceptions
- "Do you know who I am?" mentality
- Grandiose future claims with thin evidence

**Narcissistic Supply Needs:**
- Admiration and validation
- Status recognition
- Being seen as special/unique
- Winning (even symbolically)

**Negotiation Strategy (High-N):**
- Feed ego strategically (but not obsequiously)
- Frame requests as their idea
- Let them "win" on visible dimensions
- Protect their public image
- Avoid direct confrontation of self-image

### Machiavellianism Deep Dive

**High Mach Indicators:**
- Information asymmetry seeking
- Quid pro quo thinking explicit
- Long-term strategic patience
- Comfortable with deception for goals
- Views trust as a tool, not a value
- Coalition and alliance building
- Tests others' boundaries incrementally

**Machiavellian Tactics:**
- Divide and conquer
- Strategic ambiguity
- Loyalty tests
- Controlled information release
- Creating dependency

**Negotiation Strategy (High-M):**
- Assume information advantage attempts
- Verify independently
- Make commitments explicit and documented
- Expect incremental boundary pushing
- Build escape clauses

### Psychopathy Deep Dive

**High Psychopathy Indicators:**
- Glib, superficial charm
- Lack of realistic long-term goals
- Pathological lying (even when unnecessary)
- Lack of remorse for harm caused
- Parasitic reliance on others
- Impulsive decision-making
- Failure to honor commitments
- Blame externalization

**Risk Assessment (High-P):**
- Higher probability of broken agreements
- May escalate unpredictably
- Short-term opportunism over long-term benefit
- Dangerous if cornered

**Negotiation Strategy (High-P):**
- Document everything
- Minimize trust dependencies
- Build in verification checkpoints
- Have exit strategies
- Don't corner them
- Short-term, verifiable commitments only

### Dark Triad Interaction Patterns

| Combination | Behavioral Pattern | Risk Level |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| High N, Low M, Low P | Grandiose but transparent | Moderate (predictable) |
| Low N, High M, Low P | Cold strategist | High (calculated) |
| Low N, Low M, High P | Chaotic exploiter | High (unpredictable) |
| High N, High M, Low P | Malignant narcissist | Very High |
| High N, Low M, High P | Narcissistic psychopath | Very High |
| Low N, High M, High P | Corporate psychopath | Very High |
| High N, High M, High P | "Dark Triad Trifecta" | Extreme |

## MICE/RASP Motivation Framework

These frameworks identify primary motivational drivers. See `references/motive-analysis.md` for detailed application.

### MICE (Intelligence Community Standard)

| Driver | Description | Indicators |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Money** | Financial motivation | Debt mentions, lifestyle aspirations, price sensitivity, monetary framing |
| **Ideology** | Belief-based motivation | Cause language, moral framing, "right thing to do", sacrifice willingness |
| **Coercion** | Fear-based motivation | Threat awareness, compliance language, mention of consequences, trapped feeling |
| **Ego** | Status/recognition motivation | Achievement focus, comparison to others, legacy concerns, credit seeking |

### RASP (Extended Framework)

| Driver | Description | Indicators |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Reward** | Tangible benefit seeking | "What's in it for me", explicit trade framing, deal-making orientation |
| **Ideology** | Value/belief alignment | Mission language, principles, "it's about more than..." |
| **Punishment/Coercion** | Avoidance of negative outcomes | Fear language, "or else" thinking, compliance focus |
| **Ego/Status** | Recognition and self-image | Legacy talk, uniqueness claims, competitive framing |

## Archetype Quick Reference

### Negotiation Archetypes

| Archetype | OCEAN Profile | Dark Triad | Primary MICE | Strategy |
|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Collaborator** | High A, High O | Low all | Ideology | Build relationship, win-win framing |
| **Competitor** | Low A, High C | Moderate M | Ego | Let them win publicly, trade for substance |
| **Avoider** | Low E, High N | Low all | Coercion | Reduce anxiety, provide safety |
| **Accommodator** | High A, High E | Low all | Relationship | Don't exploit, reciprocate fairly |
| **Shark** | Low A, Low N | High M, P | Money | Document, verify, short leash |
| **Peacock** | High E | High N | Ego | Feed ego, protect image, frame as their idea |

### Warning Archetypes

| Pattern | Indicators | Risk |
|---------|------------|------|
| **The Martyr** | High N, Ideology-driven, victim narrative | Unpredictable escalation |
| **The Fixer** | High M, transactional, everything negotiable | May betray if outbid |
| **The True Believer** | Ideology-locked, Low O, High C | Inflexible, may sacrifice self |
| **The Chameleon** | High M, shifting presentation | Authentic goals unclear |
| **The Chaos Agent** | High P, impulsive, thrill-seeking | Unpredictable, dangerous |

## Cultural Calibration Warning

**CRITICAL**: All indicators must be calibrated against cultural baselines.

| Dimension | High-Context Cultures | Low-Context Cultures |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Directness** | Indirect = normal, not deceptive | Direct = normal, not aggressive |
| **Emotional Display** | Reserved = normal, not cold | Expressive = normal, not unstable |
| **Self-Promotion** | Modest = normal, not Low-N | Confident = normal, not High-N |
| **Conflict Style** | Avoidant = normal, not weak | Confrontational = normal, not aggressive |

**Before profiling**: Establish cultural baseline. Compare to *their* norm, not yours.

---

## Application Protocol

1. **Establish baseline** (Phase 1-P): Observe communication at ease
2. **Map OCEAN traits** (Phase 3-P): Position on each dimension
3. **Assess Dark Triad** (Phase 3-P): Check all three, note interactions
4. **Identify MICE drivers** (Phase 4-P): What motivates action?
5. **Classify archetype** (Phase 4-P): Match pattern for strategy
6. **Cultural calibrate** (Throughout): Adjust for cultural context

**Output Format:**
```
OCEAN: O[L/M/H] C[L/M/H] E[L/M/H] A[L/M/H] N[L/M/H]
Dark Triad: Narcissism[L/M/H] Mach[L/M/H] Psychopathy[L/M/H]
Primary MICE: [Money/Ideology/Coercion/Ego]
Archetype: [Classification]
Confidence: [Low/Med/High]
Cultural Calibration: [Applied/Needed]
