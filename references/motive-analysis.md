## MICE Framework (Intelligence Community Standard)

The MICE framework identifies four primary motivational categories that drive human behavior, particularly relevant in security, negotiation, and influence contexts.

### Money

**Core Drive**: Financial gain, economic security, lifestyle improvement.

#### Indicators

| Signal | Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Explicit financial mentions** | References to debt, expenses, aspirations | High |
| **Lifestyle-income gap** | Living beyond means, or visibly frustrated by constraints | Medium |
| **Price sensitivity** | Negotiates aggressively on compensation | Medium |
| **Monetization framing** | "What's the ROI on this?" for non-financial decisions | Medium |
| **Financial stress markers** | Mentions bills, loans, "making ends meet" | High |
| **Comparative compensation talk** | "They're paying X at competitor" | Medium |

#### Exploitation Vulnerability

Money-motivated individuals are vulnerable when:
- Facing financial pressure
- Presented with low-risk financial opportunity
- Feeling underpaid relative to contribution
- Lifestyle exceeds income

#### Negotiation Strategy

- Quantify benefits in financial terms
- Offer performance-based compensation
- Create financial incentive alignment
- Be direct about financial arrangements

#### Counter-Intelligence Note

Money motivation is easiest to satisfy but creates:
- Ongoing vulnerability to higher bidder
- Transactional relationship
- Limited loyalty beyond payment

---

### Ideology

**Core Drive**: Beliefs, values, causes, principles, moral frameworks.

#### Indicators

| Signal | Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Cause language** | "It's about more than just...", "The right thing to do" | High |
| **Moral framing** | "That's wrong/right", "We have a responsibility" | High |
| **Sacrifice willingness** | Accepts personal cost for principle | High |
| **Consistency** | Positions align across contexts | Medium |
| **Group identification** | Strong in-group/out-group language | Medium |
| **Symbol sensitivity** | Reacts to ideological markers | Medium |

#### Ideology Subcategories

| Type | Core Belief | Leverage Point |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Political** | Governance, power, justice | Frame as advancing cause |
| **Religious/Spiritual** | Divine order, afterlife, karma | Frame as righteous action |
| **Ethical** | Right/wrong, fairness | Frame as ethical imperative |
| **Nationalist** | Country, culture, heritage | Frame as patriotic duty |
| **Professional** | Standards, excellence, integrity | Frame as professional obligation |

#### Exploitation Vulnerability

Ideology-motivated individuals are vulnerable when:
- Presented with "greater good" rationalization
- Belief system is threatened
- In-group loyalty conflicts with other obligations
- Actions can be framed as serving the cause

#### Negotiation Strategy

- Align proposal with their values
- Frame in ideological terms they accept
- Don't challenge core beliefs directly
- Find shared principles as common ground
- Let them feel they're serving their cause

#### Counter-Intelligence Note

True believers are:
- Most reliable once aligned
- Most dangerous once opposed
- Resistant to monetary incentives
- May self-sacrifice unpredictably

---

### Coercion/Compromise

**Core Drive**: Fear, self-preservation, protecting secrets, avoiding consequences.

#### Indicators

| Signal | Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Threat awareness** | Hypervigilant, mentions risks frequently | Medium |
| **Compliance without enthusiasm** | Does what's asked but no more | Medium |
| **Trapped language** | "I have no choice", "What else can I do?" | High |
| **Secret-keeping behavior** | Compartmentalized information, evasive | Medium |
| **Defensive about past** | Over-explains or avoids certain topics | Medium |
| **Fear responses** | Anxiety about consequences | High |

#### Coercion Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Ethical Note |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Legal exposure** | Fear of prosecution, liability | Legitimate in compliance contexts |
| **Reputation risk** | Fear of exposure, embarrassment | Ethically questionable leverage |
| **Physical threat** | Fear of harm | Generally illegitimate |
| **Economic threat** | Fear of job loss, financial ruin | Context-dependent |
| **Social threat** | Fear of ostracism, relationship loss | Ethically questionable |
| **Compromise material** | Leverage from past actions | Generally illegitimate |

#### Recognizing Coerced Behavior

- Sudden behavioral changes without explanation
- Compliance that contradicts stated values
- Avoiding documentation or witnesses
- Working odd hours unnecessarily
- Unexplained access to unusual systems/information

#### Negotiation Strategy (Ethical)

For genuinely coerced individuals:
- Provide safe exit paths
- Address underlying fear
- Offer protection if possible
- Build trust incrementally

For leveraging compliance concerns:
- Make requirements clear
- Document expectations
- Create accountability structures
- Use legitimate authority

---

### Ego

**Core Drive**: Status, recognition, self-image, legacy, being seen as important/special.

#### Indicators

| Signal | Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Achievement focus** | Lists accomplishments, credentials | Medium |
| **Comparison to others** | "I was the first to...", "Unlike others..." | High |
| **Credit sensitivity** | Reacts to attribution of their work | High |
| **Legacy language** | "I want to be remembered for..." | High |
| **Title/status concern** | Values symbolic recognition | Medium |
| **Expert positioning** | Establishes authority frequently | Medium |

#### Ego Subtypes

| Type | Core Need | Leverage Point |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Achievement** | Accomplishment recognition | Frame as accomplishment opportunity |
| **Status** | Position/rank | Offer status markers |
| **Expertise** | Being seen as authority | Seek their expert opinion |
| **Uniqueness** | Special treatment | Make them feel exceptional |
| **Legacy** | Lasting impact | Frame as historical contribution |

#### Exploitation Vulnerability

Ego-motivated individuals are vulnerable when:
- Recognition is withheld
- Others receive credit for their work
- Their expertise is questioned
- Status is threatened
- Legacy is at stake

#### Negotiation Strategy

- Acknowledge their expertise/position
- Let them win on visible dimensions
- Frame requests as seeking their wisdom
- Protect their public image
- Give credit generously
- Create opportunities for recognition

#### Counter-Intelligence Note

High-ego individuals:
- Are predictable once needs mapped
- Can be manipulated through flattery (but may resent it if obvious)
- May take excessive risks to protect image
- Will defend status vigorously

## RASP Framework (Extended Model)

RASP provides an alternative/complementary framing.

| RASP | MICE Equivalent | Key Difference |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Reward** | Money (expanded) | Includes non-financial benefits |
| **Ideology** | Ideology | Same |
| **Punishment** | Coercion | Emphasizes avoidance |
| **Status** | Ego | Emphasizes social position |

---

## Drive Matrix Construction

### Step 1: Evidence Collection

For each MICE category, collect:
- Direct statements
- Behavioral evidence
- Historical patterns
- Third-party information

### Step 2: Weight Assignment

| Evidence Type | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Direct statement under stress | High |
| Consistent behavior pattern | High |
| Single behavioral instance | Low |
| Third-party report | Medium |
| Inference from context | Low |

### Step 3: Matrix Formation

```
Subject: _______________

| Driver | Evidence Count | Weight | Confidence |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|
| Money | | | |
| Ideology | | | |
| Coercion | | | |
| Ego | | | |

Primary Driver: ______________ (Highest evidence × weight)
Secondary Driver: ____________
Conflict Points: ______________
```

### Step 4: Interaction Analysis

| Combination | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Money + Ego | Compensation must include status markers |
| Ideology + Ego | Must be seen as principled leader |
| Coercion + Money | Desperate, high exploitation risk |
| Ideology + Coercion | Conflicted, may flip |

---

## Temporal Evolution

Motives change over time. Track:

| Life Stage | Typical Shifts |
|------------|----------------|
| **Early Career** | Ego (proving self), Money (establishing) |
| **Mid Career** | Status, Money (lifestyle), Ideology (meaning) |
| **Late Career** | Legacy (Ego variant), Ideology (values) |
| **Crisis** | Any → Coercion, Money |
| **Success** | Money → Ego → Ideology |

### Trigger Events

Watch for motive shifts after:
- Financial events (windfall, loss, divorce)
- Status events (promotion, demotion, recognition)
- Ideological events (scandal, revelation, conversion)
- Threat events (legal, health, relationship)

---

## Motive Conflict Analysis

### Internal Conflicts

When subject shows conflicting motives:

| Conflict | Resolution Pattern | Stress Level |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Money vs. Ideology | Short-term: Money wins. Long-term: Ideology resurfaces | High |
| Ego vs. Money | Usually Ego wins if basic needs met | Medium |
| Ego vs. Ideology | Rationalizes ideology serves ego | Medium |
| Any vs. Coercion | Coercion dominates under active threat | Very High |

### Leverage Conflicts

When your leverage conflicts with their motive:

| Their Motive | Your Leverage | Approach |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Ideology | Money | Frame money as serving ideology |
| Ego | Coercion | Private pressure, public face-saving |
| Money | Ego | Quantify status in financial terms |
| Ideology | Ego | Make them the hero of the cause |

---

## Prediction Framework

Once motive is established, predict behavior:

### If Primary = Money
- Will optimize for financial outcome
- Responds to quantified benefits
- May shift allegiance if outbid
- Time horizon: Short to medium

### If Primary = Ideology
- Will act according to belief system
- Responds to values alignment
- Resistant to financial incentives
- Time horizon: Long (cause-based)

### If Primary = Coercion
- Will comply under threat
- Responds to fear reduction
- Unreliable if threat removed
- Time horizon: Immediate (threat-based)

### If Primary = Ego
- Will protect self-image
- Responds to recognition
- Predictable through status appeals
- Time horizon: Medium (legacy-based)
