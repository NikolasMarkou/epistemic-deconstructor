## Baseline Establishment

Before analyzing deviations, establish the subject's normal communication patterns.

### Baseline Metrics to Capture

| Metric | Description | How to Measure |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Sentence Length** | Average words per sentence | Count words / count sentences |
| **Response Latency** | Time between receiving and responding | Timestamp deltas |
| **Vocabulary Complexity** | Lexical sophistication | Avg word length, syllable count |
| **Emoji/Punctuation Density** | Expressive markers per message | Count !, ?, emojis |
| **Pronoun Ratio** | I/We/They distribution | Count and divide |
| **Question Frequency** | How often they ask vs. state | Count questions / total sentences |
| **Hedge Density** | Uncertainty markers | Count hedges / total words |

### Baseline Observation Period

- **Minimum**: 5-10 exchanges at ease (non-stressful topics)
- **Ideal**: Multiple contexts (professional, casual, stressed)
- **Document**: Create explicit baseline profile before analysis

## Pronoun Analytics

Pronoun usage reveals psychological orientation, group identification, and responsibility attribution.

### First Person Singular ("I", "me", "my")

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| High frequency | Self-focus, ownership, possible narcissism |
| Low frequency under pressure | Distancing from responsibility |
| Sudden increase | Personal stake, emotional involvement |
| Sudden decrease | Deflection, group diffusion |

### First Person Plural ("we", "us", "our")

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Authentic "we" | Group identification, collaboration |
| Royal "we" | Grandiosity (especially if alone) |
| Diffusing "we" | Spreading responsibility |
| Inclusive "we" | Building alliance |
| Exclusive "we" (we vs. they) | In-group signaling |

### Third Person ("they", "them", "those")

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Distancing "they" | Othering, blame externalization |
| Respectful "they" | Acknowledgment without alliance |
| Hostile "they" | Out-group hostility |

### Pronoun Shift Analysis

| Shift | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| I → We | Diffusing responsibility OR building alliance |
| We → I | Taking ownership OR separating from group |
| We → They | Distancing from previously claimed group |
| Named → Pronoun | Depersonalization (often negative) |
| Pronoun → Named | Re-personalization (often positive) |

## Distancing Language

Distancing markers indicate psychological separation from content - often seen in deception, discomfort, or disownership.

### Verb Tense Distancing

| Pattern | Example | Signal |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Past → Present** | "I did say that" vs "I say that" | Creates temporal distance |
| **Active → Passive** | "I broke it" vs "It was broken" | Removes agency |
| **Direct → Indirect** | "I lied" vs "Mistakes were made" | Removes self from action |

### Semantic Distancing

| Pattern | Example | Signal |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Euphemism** | "Departed" vs "Died" | Softening harsh reality |
| **Abstraction** | "The situation" vs "My failure" | Depersonalization |
| **Nominalization** | "There was a breakdown" vs "I broke down" | Removes actor |
| **Category shift** | "That kind of thing" vs specific act | Vagueness |

### Psychological Distancing Markers

| Marker | Example | Signal |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Temporal** | "At that point in time" | Pushing event away |
| **Spatial** | "Over there", "That place" | Physical distance = emotional distance |
| **Social** | "Those people", "One might think" | Relationship distance |
| **Hypothetical** | "If someone were to..." | Avoiding direct claim |

---

## Deception Markers

**WARNING**: No single marker is diagnostic. Deception detection requires pattern analysis and baseline comparison.

### Statement Analysis Markers

| Marker | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Lack of conviction** | Weak assertions | "I believe", "I think", "Maybe" |
| **Convincing statements** | Unnecessary protestations | "I swear", "Honestly", "To tell the truth" |
| **Non-contracted denial** | Full form over contraction | "I did not" vs "I didn't" |
| **Bolstering** | Over-justification | Excessive detail on irrelevant points |
| **Equivocation** | Technically true but misleading | Answering different question than asked |
| **Memory gaps** | Selective amnesia | "I don't recall" on memorable events |

### Specificity Changes

| Pattern | Signal |
|---------|--------|
| **High detail → Vague** | Possible deception in vague section |
| **Vague → High detail** | Possible scripted/rehearsed section |
| **Uneven specificity** | Attention mismatch, possible fabrication |
| **Over-specific on irrelevant** | Distraction, compensation |

### Response Pattern Markers

| Pattern | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| **Delayed response** | Processing time, fabrication |
| **Immediate scripted response** | Pre-rehearsed, possibly deceptive |
| **Repeating question** | Stalling, time to fabricate |
| **Attacking question** | Deflection, possible discomfort |
| **Answering unasked question** | Anxiety about actual question |

### Linguistic Leakage

| Type | Example | Signal |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Negation leak** | "I would never steal" (unprompted) | Focus reveals concern |
| **Future tense leak** | "I wouldn't have done that" | Hypothetical framing of real event |
| **Qualifier leak** | "Basically", "Essentially" | Creating escape hatch |
| **Parenthetical leak** | Casual admission in aside | Truth slipping through |

---

## Stress Indicators

Stress markers indicate cognitive load, discomfort, or emotional activation.

### Verbal Stress Markers

| Marker | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Increased hedging** | More uncertainty markers |
| **Shorter sentences** | Cognitive bandwidth reduction |
| **Longer latency** | Processing time increase |
| **Repetition** | Stalling, emphasis, or anxiety |
| **False starts** | "I was - I mean - the thing is" |
| **Filler words** | "Um", "Uh", "Like", "You know" |
| **Grammar deterioration** | Sentence structure breakdown |

### Content Stress Markers

| Marker | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Topic avoidance** | Redirecting from sensitive areas |
| **Over-explanation** | Compensating for perceived weakness |
| **Minimization** | "It's not a big deal" on big deals |
| **Projection** | Attributing own traits to others |
| **Rationalization** | Excessive justification |

---

## Cognitive Complexity Indicators

### High Cognitive Complexity

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Conditional thinking** | "If X, then Y, but if Z..." |
| **Multiple perspectives** | "From their view... but also..." |
| **Nuanced qualifiers** | "Mostly", "In some cases", "It depends" |
| **Integration of contradiction** | "Both X and not-X can be true because..." |
| **Meta-cognitive reflection** | "I might be wrong because..." |

### Low Cognitive Complexity

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Black/white framing** | "Always", "Never", "All", "None" |
| **Single perspective** | No acknowledgment of alternatives |
| **Categorical assertions** | No qualifiers or conditions |
| **Dismissal of contradiction** | "That doesn't matter" |
| **No meta-cognition** | No self-reflection on reasoning |

### Complexity Under Stress

- Stress typically **reduces** cognitive complexity
- High-complexity thinkers may become binary under pressure
- If complexity *increases* under stress, may indicate rehearsed material

## Emotional Valence Markers

### Positive Valence

| Marker | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Approach language** | "Let's", "Together", "Looking forward" |
| **Appreciation markers** | "Thank you", "Great", "Appreciate" |
| **Future orientation** | "When we...", "After this..." |
| **Inclusive pronouns** | "We", "Us", "Our" |

### Negative Valence

| Marker | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Avoidance language** | "But", "However", "Unfortunately" |
| **Distancing** | "They", "That", "Those people" |
| **Past/static orientation** | "This always happens", "It's never..." |
| **Conditional negatives** | "If only", "Should have" |

### Valence Shift Analysis

| Shift | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Positive → Negative | Disappointment, betrayal, new information |
| Negative → Positive | Resolution, manipulation, strategic shift |
| Stable positive | Authentic satisfaction OR performance |
| Stable negative | Authentic frustration OR strategic victimhood |

## Analysis Protocol

### Step 1: Baseline (5-10 neutral exchanges)
```
Document:
- Avg sentence length: ___
- Pronoun ratios (I/We/They): ___
- Hedge density: ___
- Response latency: ___
- Emotional baseline: ___
- Complexity level: ___
```

### Step 2: Deviation Tracking
```
| Exchange | Metric | Baseline | Observed | Delta | Interpretation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| ...      | ...    | ...      | ...      | ...   | ...            |
```

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition
- Look for clusters of markers
- Note trigger topics
- Track temporal evolution
- Cross-reference with behavioral observations

### Step 4: Confidence Assessment
```
Confidence = f(baseline_quality, sample_size, marker_clustering, alternative_explanations)

Low: <5 exchanges, single markers, many alternatives
Medium: 5-10 exchanges, marker clusters, some alternatives ruled out
High: >10 exchanges, consistent patterns, alternatives tested
```

## Warning: False Positives

| Marker | Alternative Explanation |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Hesitation** | Non-native speaker, processing complex question |
| **Avoidance** | Privacy concern, not deception |
| **Distancing** | Cultural norm, not disownership |
| **Memory gaps** | Genuine memory limitation |
| **Inconsistency** | Updating beliefs, not lying |

**Rule**: Never conclude from single markers. Require pattern + context + baseline deviation.
